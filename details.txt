Developing a Text-to-Speech System for Sinhala 
Developing a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for a specific language like 
Sinhala involves multiple steps, including data collection, model 
training, and synthesis. Here's a high-level guide for creating an ML 
project for Sinhala TTS: 
1. Data Collection: 
1.1. Sinhala Speech Corpus: 
Collect a diverse and representative Sinhala speech corpus. Ensure it 
covers various speakers, accents, and speaking styles. 
1.2. Text Data: 
Align the Sinhala speech data with corresponding transcriptions. This 
data will be used to train the TTS model. 
2. Data Preprocessing: 
2.1. Text Normalization: 
Normalize Sinhala text to handle variations in spelling, punctuation, and 
word forms. 
2.2. Phonetic Transcription: 
Create a phonetic transcription of Sinhala words. If such a transcription 
system doesn't exist, you may need to develop or adapt one.

2.3. Feature Extraction: 
Extract relevant features from the audio data, such as Mel-frequency 
cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or spectrograms. 
3. Model Selection: 
3.1. Deep Learning Model: 
Choose a suitable deep learning architecture for TTS. Options include 
Tacotron, Tacotron 2, Transformer TTS, etc. 
3.2. Sinhala Language Model: 
If possible, incorporate linguistic features specific to Sinhala into the 
model, such as Sinhala phonemes or linguistic rules. 
4. Model Training: 
4.1. Train-Validation Split: 
Split the dataset into training and validation sets. 
4.2. Model Training: 
Train the TTS model using the aligned Sinhala text and speech data. 
Adjust hyperparameters as needed. 
4.3. Optimization: 
Optimize the model using evaluation metrics and fine-tune if necessary. 
5. Evaluation: 
5.1. Subjective Evaluation: 
Conduct subjective evaluations with native speakers to assess the 
naturalness and quality of the synthesized speech. 
5.2. Objective Evaluation: 
53| Introduction to Speech Processing  
Use objective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), word error 
rate (WER), or other relevant metrics. 
6. Integration: 
6.1. Integration into Application: 
Integrate the trained TTS model into the desired application or platform. 
Provide an interface for users to input Sinhala text and receive 
synthesized speech. 
6.2. User Feedback: 
Gather user feedback and make improvements based on user experience. 
7. Deployment: 
7.1. Optimization for Deployment: 
Optimize the model for deployment, considering factors like inference 
speed and resource consumption. 
7.2. Cloud Deployment (Optional): 
Consider deploying the TTS system on cloud platforms for scalability 
and accessibility. 
8. Continuous Improvement: 
8.1. Data Augmentation: 
Augment the dataset with more diverse Sinhala speech data for ongoing 
model improvement. 
8.2. Model Updates: 
Periodically update the model using additional data and retrain to 
enhance performance over time. 
Please note that developing a TTS system, especially for a specific 
language, is a complex task that may require collaboration with linguists 
and domain experts. Additionally, adapting and training TTS models for

languages with limited resources may present unique challenges. 
Consider leveraging pre-existing models or collaborating with experts in 
the Sinhala language to enhance the quality of your TTS system. 

Sinhala TTS using TF 
Let me provide a more concise version of the example code for Sinhala 
TTS using Tacotron 2: 
import tensorflow as tf 
from tensorflow_tts.models import Tacotron2 
from tensorflow_tts.utils import plot_alignment 
 
# Load a pre-trained Tacotron 2 model 
tacotron2 = Tacotron2() 
 
# Sample Sinhala sentence (replace it with your Sinhala 
text) 
sinhala_text = " ෙස්නාෙ ල වෙ අ ෙපාත..." 
 
# Tokenize Sinhala text (for illustration purposes) 
# Replace this with a proper tokenizer for Sinhala 
phoneme_sequence = ["s", "u", "m", "i", "t", "h", " ", "s", 
"i", "r", "i", "s", "e", "n", "a", "v", "e", " ", ...] 
 
# Convert phoneme sequence to mel spectrogram 
mel_outputs, mel_outputs_postnet, alignments = 
tacotron2.inference( 
    text=tf.convert_to_tensor([sinhala_text]), 
    
text_lengths=tf.convert_to_tensor([len(phoneme_sequence)]
 ), 
    mel_inputs=tf.convert_to_tensor([phoneme_sequence], 
dtype=tf.float32), 
    
mel_lengths=tf.convert_to_tensor([len(phoneme_sequence)])
 , 
) 
 
# Save the alignment plot as an image 
plot_alignment(alignments.numpy()[0], 
mel_length=mel_outputs_postnet.shape[1], mel_width=256, 
path="alignment.png") 


# Convert mel spectrogram to waveform 
waveform = tacotron2.mel_to_wav(mel_outputs_postnet) 
# Save the synthesized waveform as a WAV file 
tf.audio.write_wav("output.wav", 
waveform[0], 
sample_rate=tacotron2.sample_rate.numpy()) 
In this example, you need to replace the placeholder Sinhala sentence and 
phoneme sequence with your actual Sinhala text and the corresponding 
phoneme representation. Additionally, make sure to install the required 
libraries using the provided pip install command before running the 
code. 
Creating a phoneme sequence for Sinhala involves representing each 
phoneme or sound in the language with a corresponding symbol. Please 
note that creating an accurate phoneme representation for Sinhala might 
require linguistic expertise or access to a well-established phonetic 
transcription system for the language. Here's a simplified example: 
# Sample Sinhala sentence 
sinhala_text = " 
ෙස්නාෙ ල වෙ අ ෙපාත..." 
# Placeholder phoneme sequence (replace this with a proper 
phoneme representation) 
phoneme_sequence = ["s", "u", "m", "i", "t", "h", " ", "s", 
"i", "r", "i", "s", "e", "n", "a", "v", "e", " ", ...] 
# Rest of the code remains the same... 
For a comprehensive and accurate phonetic representation of Sinhala, 
you may want to consult linguistic resources or collaborate with experts 
in Sinhala linguistics. Alternatively, you can explore existing phonetic 
transcription systems if available.

It's worth noting that the creation of a phonetic transcription system for a 
language involves a deep understanding of its phonological 
characteristics, and creating an accurate representation may be a non
trivial task. Phonetic transcription is often done by linguists or language 
experts who study the phonetics of the language in detail. If a 
standardized phonetic transcription system for Sinhala is not available, it 
might be necessary to collaborate with experts in Sinhala linguistics to 
develop one. 
Creating a phoneme sequence 
Creating a phoneme sequence for a language involves representing the 
sounds in the language with corresponding symbols. Since a detailed 
phonetic transcription system for Sinhala might not be readily available, 
let's consider a simple example with basic phonetic representations. 
Please note that this is a highly simplified example and may not 
accurately reflect the phonetics of Sinhala. 

# Sample Sinhala sentence 
sinhala_text = " ෙස්නාෙ ල වෙ අ ෙපාත..." 
 
# Placeholder phoneme sequence (simplified representation) 
phoneme_sequence = [ 
    "s", "u", "m", "i", "t", "h", " ",  # Consonants and 
vowels 
    "s", "i", "r", "i", "s", "e", "n", "a", "v", "e", " ",  
# More consonants and vowels 
    "m", "i", "h", "i", "r", "a", " ",  # 
 
Certainly, let's simplify the example with a shorter Sinhala sentence and 
a more straightforward phonetic representation: 

# Sample Sinhala sentence 
sinhala_text = " ෙස්නාෙ ල වෙ අ ෙපාත..." 
 
# Placeholder phoneme sequence (simplified representation) 
phoneme_sequence = [ 
    "su", "mi", "th", " ",  # Consonants and vowels 
    "si", "ri", "se", "na", "ve", " ",  # More consonants 
and vowels 
    "mu", "la", " ",  # Another word 
    "di", "va", "ye", " ",  # Another word 
    "a", "to", "pe", " ",  # Another word 
] 
 
# Rest of the code remains the same... 

In this simplified example, the phoneme sequence is represented in a 
more straightforward manner. Each element in the phoneme_sequence 
corresponds to a basic phonetic unit (a combination of consonants and 
vowels) in Sinhala. This is a highly simplified representation for 
illustrative purposes. In practice, creating an accurate phonetic 
representation for Sinhala would require a more sophisticated approach 
and linguistic expertise.
